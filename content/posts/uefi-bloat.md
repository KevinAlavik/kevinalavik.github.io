## Why UEFI is Bloat and Computers Belong in the 90s

Remember when computers just worked? You'd hit the power button, hear a satisfying beep, and be greeted by a simple blue screen with white text. No bloated firmware, no cryptic secure boot errors — just your trusty BIOS doing its job like a champion. 

Then along came UEFI, bringing with it a mountain of complexity nobody asked for.

### The Case Against UEFI

1. **Unnecessary Complexity**  
   BIOS was straightforward. UEFI feels like someone tried to turn firmware into an operating system. Why does my bootloader need a GUI? 

2. **Bloated Features Nobody Needs**  
   Network stack? Mouse support? Booting from massive drives we’ll never fill? It’s like they threw everything in just because they could.

3. **Secure Boot — But for Whom?**  
   Secure Boot sounds great in theory, but in practice? It locks people out of running their own code. Computers are meant to be hacked, customized, and bent to their owner's will — not shackled by firmware that answers to Microsoft.

4. **BIOS Had Soul**  
   Those clunky menus and limited options? That was part of the charm. You weren’t supposed to fiddle with a dozen boot options — you just picked your disk and let it rip.

### Bring Back BIOS  
UEFI may have won the war, but it doesn't have to win our hearts. Let’s build systems that respect the simplicity of the past. Where a PC boots like a real PC — not a smartphone pretending to be a server.  

BIOS forever.
